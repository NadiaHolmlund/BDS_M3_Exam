The following project was completed to finish the first semester on the MSc programme in Business Data Science at Aalborg University. During the exam we had the opportunity to apply our skills in python and streamlit, focusing on creating a data driven business solution for the collaborating company. In our case, we developed a tool to predict football player ratings and identify player shortcomings on key performance indicators for a given position on the field. This to allow scouts to identify players with the highest potential of succeeding in professional sports.
